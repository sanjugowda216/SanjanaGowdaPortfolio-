                <h3>Computer Science Essentials - Mr. Baez Period 5: November 1st, 2023 (Semester 1) </h3>
                <p>The Magic 8 Ball was one of the first projects I worked on with Shely, whom I did not know very will in the beginning of the school year. The website was made for fun and mainly expiremental, which is one of my favorite projects because although it wasn't as advanced, it was a stepping stone into our love for UI and UX of a website. I specifically worked on the spinner where different buttons would spin the 8 Ball, but as beginner coders, we definitly ran into many issues that we had to overcome (such as the several lags between when the button was clicked and when the ball would start spinning).</p>

                <h2>Emerald High School Bell Schedule</h2>
                <h3>Computer Science Essentials - Mr. Baez Period 5: May 15th, 2024 (Semester 2) </h3>
                <p>The EHS Bell Schedule was made as a part of the entrepreneuarship project. It was one of our most recent projects as a team and I took a main part in creating the feature where the user can enter the desired name or message of their class and it would display accordingly to the bell schedule. We were quite ambitious with this project as a team, but definitly ran into some cncepts that were a lot more advanced than we had experience with. The project generally taught me how to work forward and how to find better alternatives for ideas that fit my personal skill level but also force me a little harder to try my best.</p>
