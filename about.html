        <h2>Hi my name is Sanjana Gowda and I am a fifteen year old at Emerald High School. I am currently in the Computer Science and Essentials class. I want to pursue computer science, hopfully at a top computer science school. My dream colleges include UC Berkely and MIT.</h2>
        <h2>I was very fortunate to have a good group of friends in my computer science class this year. Since they shared my passions and values, I really looked forward to the class. We attended hackathons as a group which taught me a lot about coding and working on projects in a team setting. This gave me insight on how I want to work as a programmer, and how collaborating with other people will be!</h2>
